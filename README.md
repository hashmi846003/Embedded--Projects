## Introduction This project demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to an STM32F407 microcontroller. The LED toggles on and off every 100 milliseconds. 
## Hardware Requirements 
- STM32F407 Discovery board -
- USB cable
- LED (if not using the onboard LED)
- Breadboard and jumper wires (if using an external LED)
- ## Software Requirements - STM32CubeIDE - STM32CubeMX (optional)
